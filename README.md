📚 A minimalistic TUI (terminal-user-interface) manager for browser bookmarks.

- Import bookmarks from any Chromium/Firefox HTML export  
- Navigate, search, add, edit, delete and **open** bookmarks without leaving your terminal  
- All data live in a single SQLite file  
- Keyboard-driven workflow with instant search and two-pane layout (list + details)

## Features

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | start incremental search (focus jumps to top bar) |
| `Enter` | open highlighted URL with system `xdg-open` (Win/Mac/Linux) |
| `a` | add new bookmark |
| `e` | edit current bookmark (including parent folder ID) |
| `d` | delete current bookmark |
| `Esc` | cancel search / close form |

- Search filters **live** while you type (title, URL, description)  
- Two-pane view: left side – compact list, right side – full details  
- Status bar at the bottom always shows available hot-keys  
- Stores folder structure (parent ID) – useful for future tree view expansion
