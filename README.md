📚 A minimalistic TUI (terminal-user-interface) manager for browser bookmarks.

- Import bookmarks from any Chromium/Firefox HTML export  
- Navigate, search, add, edit, delete and **open** bookmarks without leaving your terminal  
- All data live in a single SQLite file  
- Keyboard-driven workflow with instant search and two-pane layout (list + details)

## Features

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | switch focus between folders tree and bookmarks list |
| `/` | start incremental search (focus jumps to top bar) |
| `Enter` | open highlighted URL / select folder in tree |
| `a` | add new bookmark |
| `e` | edit current bookmark (including parent folder ID) |
| `d` | delete current bookmark |
| `Esc` | cancel search / close form |
| `q` | quit application |

- **Folder filtering** - click on folders to filter bookmarks by folder
- Search filters **live** while you type (title, URL, description)  
- Three-pane view: folders tree (left), bookmarks list (center), details (right)  
- Status bar at the bottom always shows available hot-keys  
- Stores folder structure (parent ID) with hierarchical tree view

## Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_NAME/bookmarkcli.git
cd bookmarkcli
go mod tidy

# 1) import bookmarks once
go run ./cmd/bookmarks-cli --import ~/bookmarks.html

# 2) run the TUI
go run ./cmd/bookmarks-cli
```

Build binary:
```bash
go build -o build/bookmarks-cli ./cmd/bookmarks-cli
./build/bookmarks-cli
```

### Configuration

By default, the database is stored at `~/.bookmarks/bookmarks.db`. You can specify a custom path:

```bash
go run ./cmd/bookmarks-cli --db /path/to/custom.db
```

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models** - Domain entities (Bookmark, Folder)
- **Repository** - Data access layer with interfaces (easy to swap databases)
- **Service** - Business logic layer
- **UI** - Terminal user interface (TUI)
- **Parser** - HTML bookmark parser
- **Commands** - CLI command handlers
- **Config** - Configuration management

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed architecture documentation.
